Internship challenge for DroneDeploy

### Requirements:

1. Frontend:

- Preferred: Angular (extra credit for using TypeScript)
- Fallback: Use a frontend framework you are comfortable with (React, Vue, etc.).
- Build a clean, responsive UI that allows users to input and receive information.
- Display the drone data provided on the page in a simple table or card format.
- Input box for user queries (e.g., “What is the altitude of the second image?” or “What is the battery level of the drone during the last image?”).
- Display the AI response or the mock response.

### 2. API:

- Preferred: Python (e.g., Flask or FastAPI).
- Fallback: Use Node.js or another language if you are not familiar with Python.
- The backend should:
  - Receive a user query.
  - Use an AI service (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic) to interpret the question and retrieve the relevant data.
  - If AI service integration is not possible in the allotted time, mock the response with some minimal logic and return it to the front end.

### 3. AI Integration (Optional but encouraged):

- Integrate with Gemini, OpenAI, or Anthropic to handle natural language queries.
- If AI integration is not feasible, provide a mock response.

### 4. Optional Bonus:

- Use TypeScript if working with Angular or another framework that supports it.
- Add a feature that allows sorting or filtering the drone data table based on user-selected criteria.
- Implement basic unit tests.

### 5. Instructions:

- Provide clear instructions on how to run both the frontend and backend.
- Ensure that the app can be run locally with minimal setup

### Timebox:

- This task should take 2-4 hours to complete.
- Evaluation Criteria:
  - Frontend: Clean UI/UX, input handling, and responsiveness.
  - Backend: Clean API design, AI (or mock) integration, and ability to answer user queries accurately.
  - Overall: Code clarity, structure.
